# Notes
- pcap_analyser.py and all associated scripts MUST be run with python 3.10 as they
  make use of the Type Union operator and the Type Alias annotation which was added
  with 3.10
- pylint: disable=E0401 is commented at the start of each module
  this is due to the installed packages specified in the requirements.txt
  are not always pylint compliant.
